[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jagatjeevan/jestSpike.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jagatjeevan/jestSpike)

This is a small attempt to create loadash functionality with array functions. The 'src' folder has all the code for functionality and the 'test' folder has all the test for the functionality. Here we are mimicing [loadash](https://lodash.com/) functionality.

# Folder structure
*src* : Functionality lies here.
*test* : All the code has the test. Tried to cover all the scenarios

# Things used here
- ES6 : To write in a cleaner fashion
- Yarn : To better manage dependencies
- Jest : Testing framework
- Travis : To state the build status
